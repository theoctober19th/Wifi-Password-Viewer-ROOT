# Wifi Password Viewer [ROOT]

Wifi Password Viewer is a simple and lightweight android application that allows the user to view the wifi passwords stored in their devices. Root permision is required to read the stored wifi passwords.

I worked on this project specifically to learn about root android development. The app is not complete yet.
